This project implements a **Neural Style Transfer** model using **TensorFlow** and **VGG19**, which allows you to apply artistic styles from one image (style image) to another (content image). The result is a visually captivating image that blends the content of a photograph with the aesthetics of artwork ‚Äî effectively turning photos into paintings using deep learning.

## üìú Project Description

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends two images: a content image and a style image, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This project uses the **pre-trained VGG19 model** to extract and manipulate image features and construct a new image that maintains the content of the original photo while adopting the artistic characteristics of a chosen style image.

The core idea involves:
- Extracting high-level content representations from the **content image** using the deeper layers of the CNN.
- Extracting stylistic features from the **style image** using the shallower layers.
- Generating a target image and iteratively updating it by minimizing the content and style loss functions to blend both types of features.

This implementation is optimized using **TensorFlow 2.x** and uses **Adam optimizer** for gradient-based optimization. The training loop applies both content and style weights to refine the image progressively over multiple iterations.

This project can be applied to:
- Transform landscape photos into Van Gogh-like paintings.
- Create artistic renditions of selfies using styles from famous artworks.
- Generate creative content for posters, media, and marketing.

## üß† How it Works

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Load and resize content & style images.
   - Convert them to tensors and normalize using VGG19 preprocessing.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract intermediate layers from VGG19: deeper for content, shallower for style.
   - Compute Gram matrices to capture texture patterns in style features.

3. **Loss Calculation**:
   - Content loss: Difference between generated image and content image features.
   - Style loss: Difference between Gram matrices of generated image and style image.
   - Total loss = Content loss √ó weight + Style loss √ó weight

4. **Optimization**:
   - Using Adam optimizer and gradient tape.
   - The target image is iteratively updated to minimize total loss.
